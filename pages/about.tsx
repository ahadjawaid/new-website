  ["Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, stated in May of 2016 that society is on the cusp of entering the golden age of artificial intelligence (AI). That, over the next two decades, human society and AI will become intertwined in a way that would seem like science fiction today. That modern AI tools, such as Alexa, IBM Watson, and Google TensorFlow, only scratch the surface of what's possible.", false],
  ["A month after Mr. Bezos' statement, the Artificial Intelligence Society (AIS) was born. In fact, our organization began under the general fascination of the impact that AI has already made on the world. Whether that be through Netflix's movie recommendations or Facebook's facial recognition software, it is incredible how ubiquitous AI has become in our daily lives. But as of today, many of the fascinating aspects of AI are largely unknown to the general public.", false],
  ["We want to change that.", true],
  ["Since 2019, AIS has hosted at least 9 workshops, 6 talks, and 3 iterations of HackAI, a full day of learning about the field of AI with over 400 participants. Regardless of age, major, or occupation, we believe that AI is for everyone, as it has become more common in much of our everyday activities, whether it's YouTube recommendations or facial recognition. At AIS, we hope to delve into the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence, as well as showcasing its massive potential.", false],
